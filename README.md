# ProofPay - Social Payments Platform

<img src="https://rvpptly5bhkny5oc.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Proof%20of%20Work" alt="Logo" width="150"/>

A trustless task payment platform supporting Soft, zkTLS, and Hybrid proof systems on the XION blockchain. Create tasks, submit verifiable proofs, and get paid automatically with cryptographic verification or manual review.

## üéØ Features

- **Soft Proofs**: Manual review for subjective work (content creation, design, etc.)
- **zkTLS Proofs**: Cryptographic verification of API responses (instant, no human review)
- **Hybrid Proofs**: zkTLS verification + manual review window for complex tasks
- **Real-time Updates**: Live task status updates via Supabase realtime
- **Push Notifications**: OneSignal integration for mobile alerts
- **Secure File Storage**: Signed URLs for evidence uploads
- **Auto-release Timers**: Hybrid tasks auto-release unless disputed

## üöÄ Quick Demo

**One-command setup:**
```bash
npm run demo:setup
```

This starts:
- Blockchain indexer (port 3001)
- Mock zkTLS verifier (port 3002)  
- React Native app with test data
- Supabase realtime sync

**Demo takes 3-5 minutes** - see [DEMO.md](DEMO.md) for complete walkthrough.

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **React Native** (Expo)
- **Expo Router** (tab navigation)
- **TypeScript**
- **XION Blockchain** (smart contract integration)
- **Abstraxion** (wallet authentication)
- **Custom Design System** (for colors, spacing, typography)
- **React Native** with Expo Router for cross-platform mobile
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

3. Start sending payments and requests

### Intuitive Payment Flow

## üìù Key Screens

- **Create Tab:**

  - Select payment type (Help, Request, Pay)
  - Enter recipient username (display only, not editable)
  - Enter amount (inline editable)
  - Select proof type (None, Text, Photo, zkTLS)
  - Add description (with tab-specific placeholder)
  - Submit payment/help request

- **Activity Tab:**

  - View recent payments and help requests

- **Profile Tab:**

  - View and edit user profile, wallet address, and settings

- **Username Setup:**
  - Onboarding for new users with real-time validation

### Innovation

- First social payment app with integrated zkTLS verification

## üõ°Ô∏è Proof Types

- **None:** No proof required
- **Text Proof:** Enter a short explanation
- **Photo Proof:** Attach a photo
- **zkTLS Proof:** Zero-knowledge proof for advanced verification

# Clone the repository

## ÔøΩ Blockchain Security

All payments and requests are cryptographically secured and recorded on the XION blockchain. The app uses Abstraxion for wallet authentication and smart contract interaction.
