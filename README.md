# Proof of Work - Social Payments Platform

A blockchain-powered social payment app that revolutionizes how friends handle money with built-in verification and accountability.

## üöÄ Overview

Proof of Work combines the simplicity of Venmo with the security of blockchain verification. Send payments, request money, and create verifiable tasks with cryptographic proof - all within your social network.

**"Venmo meets mathematics"** - Simple P2P payments with zero-knowledge proof verification for complete transparency.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîÑ Three Payment Flows

- **Task Requests**: "Help me move furniture for $50" - request work with verifiable completion
- **Payment Requests**: "You owe me $20 for dinner" - request money with optional proof
- **Direct Payments**: "Thanks for helping!" - send money with optional verification

### üõ°Ô∏è Proof Verification System

- **Text Proof**: Simple description of work completed
- **Photo Proof**: Visual confirmation with image upload
- **zkTLS Verification**: Advanced cryptographic proof using zero-knowledge protocols
- **No Proof**: Trust-based payments for close friends

### üë• Social Network

- Username-based user discovery (@username)
- Friend requests and management
- Global user search and connection
- Blockchain-based identity system

### üîê Cryptographic Security

- All transactions secured on XION blockchain
- Zero-knowledge proofs for maximum privacy
- Immutable payment history
- Trustless verification system

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

### Frontend

- **React Native** with Expo Router for cross-platform mobile
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Native camera and file upload integration

### Blockchain

- **XION Blockchain** for transactions and smart contracts
- **XION Dave SDK** for zkTLS and payment processing
- **Abstraxion** for wallet integration and authentication
- **IPFS** for decentralized file storage

### Smart Contract Features

- User registration and username management
- Friend network on-chain storage
- Payment escrow and release mechanisms
- Proof verification and validation
- zkTLS integration for advanced verification

## üì± User Experience

### Simple Onboarding

1. Connect wallet with Abstraxion
2. Choose unique @username
3. Start sending payments and requests

### Intuitive Payment Flow

1. Select payment type (Task/Request/Payment)
2. Choose recipient and amount
3. Add description and proof requirements
4. Send transaction

### Verification Process

1. Recipient completes task/provides proof
2. Submits verification through app
3. Payment automatically releases upon approval
4. Both parties maintain permanent record

## üèÜ Hackathon Achievement

**ü•á Checkpoint 1 Winner** - Selected as one of 3 winners from 2000+ participants in XION's "Proof of Concept" hackathon.

### Problem Solved

Traditional social payments lack accountability and verification, leading to disputes and broken trust. Proof of Work adds cryptographic verification to ensure fair exchanges.

### Innovation

- First social payment app with integrated zkTLS verification
- Blockchain-based friend networks with permanent transaction history
- Three-tier proof system for different trust levels
- Mobile-first design for mainstream adoption
