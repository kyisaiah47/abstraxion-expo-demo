# Username Registration Flow - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete username registration flow for new users connecting their wallets to the XION-based social payment platform.

## Key Features

### 1. Username Setup Screen (`app/username-setup.tsx`)

- **Real-time validation**: Checks username format and availability as user types
- **Format requirements**: 3-20 characters, alphanumeric + underscores only
- **Visual feedback**: Icons show validation status (loading, success, error)
- **Professional UI**: Consistent with app design system, includes requirements checklist
- **Wallet integration**: Shows connected wallet address for transparency

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Flow (`app/index.tsx`)

- **Smart routing**: After wallet connection, checks if user exists
- **Existing users**: Direct route to main app `/(tabs)/activity`
- **New users**: Route to username setup screen first
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback to username setup on errors

### 3. Extended UserService (`lib/userService.ts`)

- **checkUsernameAvailability()**: Async validation of username uniqueness
- **registerUsername()**: Creates new user with wallet address and username
- **Automatic user switching**: Sets newly registered user as current user
- **Mock data integration**: Works with existing friend system and user management

## User Experience Flow

1. **Wallet Connection**: User connects wallet through Abstraxion
2. **User Check**: System checks if wallet already has associated username
3. **Existing User**: → Main app (Activity tab)
4. **New User**: → Username setup screen
5. **Username Setup**:
   - Real-time validation as user types
   - Visual requirements checklist
   - Availability checking with loading states
   - Professional input with @ symbol prefix
6. **Registration**: Username stored with wallet address
7. **Main App**: User enters the full application experience
